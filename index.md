## Hello! ##

This is my personal website for showing off little experiments, writing about code, and trying out new things.

The site itself is an experiment too, I'm using [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) to host and publish the site, so that means you can rummage around [the code for the site](https://github.com/garyb/garyb.github.com) too, if you feel like it.

It's not quite ready yet, but I should have some real content up soon.
