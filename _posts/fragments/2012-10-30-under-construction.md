I've been trying to get this site up and running again for something like a 
year now. I'll get really interested in it for a few days, do some work on 
organising content for it, try to arrive at a design that I'm happy with, and 
then forget about it for a few months. I don't think I'm alone in this at 
least!

The hardest thing about it is the writing. I want to have more than just the 
imagery or interactive toys that I've previously had on here, but it takes me
so long to write the smallest bit of content that I never get anything
finished.

Perhaps throwing things up and then refining later would be the better 
approach, so here we go...

(Cue next update in 6 months time).
