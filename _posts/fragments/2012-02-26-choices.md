Since I started writing technical articles for the site (not that I've managed
to finish any) it's revealed to me just how many automatic choices I make 
while writing code without even thinking about it.

Even with the assumption that people know the language I'm using in the 
examples, I still often find myself feeling I should explain things ever 
further back in a kind of infinite regress. 

It definitely has some upsides though, it makes me examine things more deeply.
A lot of the time it seems the choices are aesthetic - not because of code 
indentation or at that superficial kind of level, but more a case of what seems
to be an elegant way of expressing something. But sometimes I find that I 
actually have no idea how or why something mathematical works, even though I 
use it all the time.

Perhaps knowing the how and why isn't all that important in a lot of cases, but
it's certainly been interesting!
